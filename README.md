# Git and Github for window 10
## Pulling repository by using Visual studion code(VSC)
### The steps are:
* download the VSC if you don't download it
* open VSC and right click on Run command then open new terminal
* go to your created repository and copy the Uniform Resource Locater(url)
* Past the url in your VSC terminal and press Enter
* Change the directory into "parents path cd your repository name"
* See all hidden files by using the command "gci -Force" because "ls -al" is not working for window 10
* "git status" used to see the status
